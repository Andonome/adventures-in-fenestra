# Adventures in Fenestra

This is a campaign setting for the BIND tabletop RPG.

## Side Quests

Eleven Side Quests are presented for three areas: forest, villages, and town.
You can slot these into an existing campaign if you're low on ideas, or use them as a miniature campaign in their own right.
A few Side Quests reference similar events or share histories, creating a semi-coherent, but eclectic narrative.

## Games Master Resources

- Magical groves, magical wells, magical items, and magical songs.
- Random encounters, random starting-backgrounds for PCs, and other random things.
- Details on the nura - the twisted versions of men, gnomes and dwarves who emerge from underground and consume everything in the area.

## Map of the Land

- Details on Fenestra, the land of magical portals.
- Ethereal lands beyond, where players can get trapped and find strange items.
- Bestiary, for all your monstrous needs.

# Using the Book

For most people, you should just download the pdf.
But if you want to modify it or add to it, you can grab all the documents, zip them, then edit the result on Overleaf, live.
If you want your own, local version, then you'll need to install Latex.
The `texlive-most` and `inkscape` packages have what you need if you're running Linux, and you can take a look at the autogen script to see how to compile it.

See the wiki for full details.
