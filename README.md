# Adventures in Fenestra
This is a campaign setting for the First Blood RPG.  It has mostly-separated sections so that GMs can focus on the bits they want.

...at least it will be once it's done.

Current structure:

## Games Master Resources

- Magical groves, magical wells, magical items, and magical songs.
- Random encounters, random starting-backgrounds for PCs, and random assorted other things.
- Details on the nura - the twisted versions of men and dwarves who emerge from underground and consume everything in the area.

## Map of the Land
- Details on Fenestra, the land of magical portals.
- Ethereal lands beyond, where players can get trapped and find strange items.
- Bestiary, for all your monstrous needs.

## Side Quests
Foreshadowing, multiple plot-arcs, and keeping track of the lot over the long term can be difficult.  Side Quests are here to help the GM.

The players enter a forest and encounter one of three stories at random: the elven prince, the Spider Queen, or just some random events.  The result is the Spider Queen, so they get part one of that Side Quest.  The next time they're about, they might get part 2, or might have a completely different  story assault them.

Side Quests can change from one area to the next, so players initially experience an assault of random hooks.  But soon, those hooks start to come together naturally.

### Requirements

A side quest must be:

- Something that happens to the players, like an encounter.
- Relatively vague about the place.  A side quest cannot happen at 'The Prancing Pony' because characters might not decide to go there.  It *can* happen 'in the street' because characters will eventually be near a street if they're in the town.
- Either contain a conclusion, or an end which loops until it is resolved, such as bandits raiding an area until their hideout is discovered.
- It must be clear how to modify a side quest when developments happen, or when to cut it and discard the rest.


Side quests can have attached locations, such as a bandit's hideout.  They do not need a particular number of parts.  One part is fine for a random encounter.  Seven parts are fine if you want a long tale.

# Using the Book

1. Install Latex packages (texlive-most has what you need)
2. Run `pdflatex main.tex && makeglossaries main && makeindex main.idx`
3. Repeat last step

If you stick in a new svg file, you'll need the `--enable-shell` command, which is a security risk.  If you don't know how that works, you can just drop me an email and I'll process any images.

# Joining

The project's still to settle into a coherent shape, so feedback and suggestions on the basic structure's greatfully accepted.  Additionally it'd be great to get:

- Art.
- Suggestions on cleaning up my code.
- New side quests.
- Suggestions on the overall structure of the thing.
