# Adventures in Fenestra

This is a campaign setting for the BIND tabletop RPG.

## Map of the Land

- Details on Fenestra, the land of magical portals.
- Ethereal lands beyond, where players can get trapped and find strange items.
- Bestiary, for all your monstrous needs.

## Games Master Resources

- Random encounters, random starting-backgrounds for PCs, and other random things.
- One bestiary, with all the creatures of Fenestra.
- Details on the nura - the twisted versions of men, gnomes and dwarves who emerge from underground and consume everything in the area.
- Magical groves, magical wells, magical items, and magical songs.

## Side Quests

Side Quests are a mechanic for presenting open-world adventures.
These storylines are cut up into small encounters, and wherever the players go, they are confronted by the next part of a story.

Unlike traditional adventures, Side Quests always happen *to* the players, so players have no impetus to go anywhere.
Instead, the next part of the story waits for them to arrive, and if they stay put then a different Side Quest rears its head.

A dozen Side Quests are presented for three areas: forest, villages, and town.
You can slot these into an existing campaign if you're low on ideas, or use them as a miniature campaign in their own right.
A few Side Quests reference similar events or share histories, creating a semi-coherent, but eclectic narrative.
