# Adventures in Fenestra

This is a campaign setting for the BIND tabletop RPG.

## Side Quests

Foreshadowing, multiple plot-arcs, and keeping track of the lot over the long term can be difficult.  Who has time for that with study and a job?  Side Quests are here to help the GM and make sure that no GM comes unprepared, even if they haven't actually prepared anything.

An individual Side Quest is a simple story in a few parts - the players hear of a mad mage, players encounter a monster made by the mad mage, and finally the players find a village destroyed by the mad mage.
That last part can be repeated until the characters confront the mage.
Details of the mad mage's lair will be given, so the players can track her down when ready.

A given area, such as 'the local forests', might have two or three Side Quests, so any time the party enter the local forest, they might become embroiled in a new Side Quest, or might encounter a new part to an existing Side Quest.
The areas presented here are 'the villages', 'the town', and 'the forest', allowing them to be slotted into almost any existing campaign.
Characters might even decide to avoid an area for a time, due to the possible danger of encountering a particularly fearsome foe.

Most Side Quests are simple enough, but a few are presented here with a bit more life, such as changing areas.
What starts as a forest encounter can switch to the centre of town, as the characters discover that the thieves they fought before, drink in a local tavern.
Some encounters don't happen alone, but add complications to 'whatever the next Side Quest is', meaning two encounters can smash into one, and the party will simply have to figure out how to handle those two encounters at the same time.

# Using the Book

For most poeple, you should just download the pdf.  But if you want to modify it or add to it, you can grab all the documents, zip them, then edit the result on Overleaf, live.  If you want your own, local version, then you'll need to install Latex.  The `texlive-most` and `inkscape` packages have what you need if you're running Linux, and you can take a look at the autogen script to see how to compile it.
