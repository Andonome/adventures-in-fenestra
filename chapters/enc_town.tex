\subsection{Random Meetings}\label{randommeetings}

\subsubsection{Pickpocketed}

\begin{boxtext}
	You feel the side of your leg and suddenly your heart stops.  Where is\ldots \textit{which item is the last one written on your character sheet?}
\end{boxtext}

The character makes a Wits + Vigilance roll, TN 9.  Failure indicates it's too late, and the thief has gone.  It might be possible to track the thief, down with enough time spent investigating, but it'll require an Intelligence + Vigilance roll at TN 11.

Gary, local pickpocket, has no excuse except for his young age, and bad luck in life, though he's 25 and was recently kicked out of an apprenticeship for drinking too heavily on the job.

\character{Gary}
\humanthief

\character{\Glsentrytext{captain}}

\Gls{captain} is heading home after a long night (if this is the afternoon, it's been a \emph{very} long night).  Play this encounter at the same time as the one below.  If the party are in trouble, he helps.  If they're known thieves, he tries to follow them, then brings guards.


\person{1}{2}{0}{{1}{-1}{+1}}{0}{2}{Academics 1, Empathy 2, Stealth 2, Survival 1\knacks{\adrenalinesurge}}{\longsword dagger, 2sp}{}

\subsubsection{The Riddle}

\begin{boxtext}
Three gods stand in front of you.  One always says the truth, one always lies, and one speaks randomly.  They refuse to speak your language, but they understand what you are saying.  You have three questions to identify each god.
\end{boxtext}

The town are abuzz with a riddle.  The mage's guilde have become tired of only getting students sent by rich parents with no real ability.  They've raised a bounty of 5gp to anyone who can solve the riddle.  Their hope is that the most talented young men of the realm will come forward, and once they do, a long talk proceeds, as the mages tell whoever gets the correct answer why they should join \gls{college}.

\subsubsection{The Nura Child}

\begin{boxtext}
	Screams errupt nearby and people flee.  Around the tavern's corner, a monster walks out.  It stoops to pick up a piece of beef one of the people had dropped, then stares at it with large, innocent eyes.
\end{boxtext}

Thomas, delivering goods on behalf of \gls{baron}, was pickpocketed by a street-child.  The child had pilfered food, enchanted to turn whoever ate it into a nura monster.

Characters can make a Wits + Medicine roll, TN 8, to notice that this monster is in fact a kid who's simply been afflicted by dark magic.

\character{James, Street-Child}
\deephobgoblin


\subsection{Illegal Songs}

\begin{boxtext}
	A little crowd have gathered in the sidestreet, occasionally clapping their hands to a beat.  Getting closer, you can hear a mandolin and a soft voice, singing of great heroes fighting back nura hordes coming up from the depth.
\end{boxtext}

The singer is \gls{bard}, and he's here to sing the praises of any nobles who might pull together an army to push back the nura, like nobles did in the old days.  However, such an army would be illegal, as only \gls{king} can gather armies, or amass large amounts of weaponry, and so far the area does not have enough of the Night Guard to defend itself.

\begin{boxtext}
	Five armoured guards arrive, and start shouting ``Move aside!'', so the crowd.  Without word of explanation, they grab the bard and drag him away.  The mandolin sits on the ground alone, and the crowd just sit there, stunned and morose.
\end{boxtext}

The guards understand who their employer is -- they're local to \gls{king} and know that it's best to avoid the notion of nobles having their own standing armies, even in songs about a long time ago.

\Gls{bard} will end up in the cells for five days, insult \gls{captain}, then stay in the cells indefinitely.

\subsubsection{Pickpockets Again!}
\begin{boxtext}
	You feel your trouser leg, and suddenly think ``Oh, not again!''.  \textit{What's the last item written on your character sheet?}
\end{boxtext}

As per last time, the player rolls Wits + Vigilance, TN 8.

This time it's a young woman, down on her luck as her family farm was raided by nura.  Raise the local nura rating by 1.

\character{Judith}

\humanthief

\subsubsection{Streetbrawl}
\begin{boxtext}
	Oi! Pointy-eared freak.  The freakshow left last week.  They decide to leave you behind?
\end{boxtext}

Trev's not happy, and he's taking it out on the group.  Pete doesn't know the group, but he's decided he's going to speak up for them and kick the crap out of Trev.  Once the fight's ended, the characters might think they're out of harm's way, but the streets are rampant with trouble.

Recently, the \gls{pig}'s decided it's time to redecorate, so all the alcoholics who have been chucked out of every area in the city are out in full swing.

\character{Irate Alcoholics}

\humanfarmer

\subsection[The Magical Item]{The Magical Item -- \encnum}

The lizardite amulet summons any item, and is exceptionally powerful as it has 30 MP in total.  It functions as per the third level conjuration sphere.  Unfortunately, it cannot be used unless the user first uses the activation word, and secondly, speaks in Gnomish.\footnote{The amulet was made by a gnomish alchemist, though the college don't like to talk about this fact.}

The amulet was loaned from \gls{college} to King Wyatt for his entertainment, and now has to return.  However, \gls{college} have already heard that news of the item's location has got out, and are aware of bandits coming to take the item.

Chief alchemical alchemist, Klaus Stein, commissioned three replicas to be created over the coming days, and transported them to the town.  The guards plan to pass them off as the real item, and have them delivered to the group carrying the real item, with a message:

\subsubsection{The Shell Game}
\begin{boxtext}
	The enemy will attack. Take this fake item.  Burry the real one, and give up the fake.
\end{boxtext}

%!
Nobody knows which road the amulet bearers will take.

\begin{boxtext}
	\begin{quotation}
	``\ldots Skill such as yours need adversity in order to flourish.  This alchemical amulat must be delivered to the crossroads, South, and at that point be given to the members of the Night Guard you see there.  At this point you must warn them that they have been targeted for an attack by \emph{the enemy}.''
	\end{quotation}

Once the general has finished his speech, he hands over a silver amulet to the group of men wearing chain armour -- apparently members of the Night Guard.  He then turns, spots you, and approaches.

	\begin{quotation}
	``Gentlemen, a mission is afoot, and I can see you are all fit and ready to stand for your king and country.  Skill such as yours need adversity in order to flourish.  This alchemical amulat must be delivered to the crossroads, South, and at that point be given to the members of the Night Guard you see there.  At this point you must warn them that they have been targeted for an attack by \emph{the enemy}.''
	\end{quotation}

\end{boxtext}

At this point the characters can accept or refuse the mission.  If they accept, they will be loaned horses.  Whichever they choose, play another encounter -- either another town encounter, or as they ride into the villages.

\paragraph{The Amulet Bearers} are five brave members of the Night Guard who have ridden for a long time.  But today, they've decided to go off-road, and rest.  The smoke from their campfire still wanders up into the sky, but they're not moving -- just resting.

\character{Five members of the Night Guard}
\humansoldier

\paragraph{The Bandits} come behind the players, hoping to lay an ambush at the crossroads.

\paragraph{The Crossroads} have a little tree coverage a stone's throw from the road -- just the place to ambush people coming from the South.

\paragraph{How this plays out} depends upon the players.  They might hide at the crossroads, or simply wait.  If waiting, the bandits may spot them first, then journey round the side to attack.  If the characters are members of the Night Guard, the bandits immediately demand the characters hand over the amulet or be killed.  Alternatively, if the characters look like normal traders, the bandits will ask what they're doing, and attempt to figure out if they might secretly be carrying the amulet.

\character{Ten Bandits}
\humansoldier

However this encounter ends, the local guard will expect both amulets to be accounted for.  If even a single one of the bandits flees, the bandit will later be captured by \gls{captain}, who will extract a confession, including what happened the the amulet.

If the players steal the amulet, they will be hunted.  Add an encounter to both the town and villages: ``Hunted''.

\paragraph{Hunted part 1} involves hearing that the characters are wanted on criminal charges, or perhaps finding out that a local has just informed the guards of their whereabouts.

\paragraph{Hunted part 2} is simply ten members of the Night Guard arriving to arrest or kill the characters.

This simple encounter repeats until the characters clear their name.

\subsubsection{Rumours of Magic}

\begin{boxtext}
	A man sprints towards you at lightning speed, carrying a book, then darts to the side and down the street.
\end{boxtext}

Players who say they want to stop him before he rushes past should make a Wits + Vigilance check at TN 9.  As soon as he's gone, three of the town guard round the corner in persuit, shouting at the characters to get him.

The thief attempts to run to \gls{pig}.

\paragraph{The backstory} is that \gls{cleverbaron} hired him to steal a the Book of Ancient Wars, detailing various battles about the time of time of King Dalius.\footnote{See page \pageref{h_dalius} for more.}  Among the various things the book talks about, it mentions the alchemical amulet which conjurs things, and describes the word which allows the user to activate its powers.  This won't be obvious as the book is very long, and very tedious.

If questioned at any point, \gls{cleverbaron} will have plenty of excuses, and in the end be given a library fine of 3cp.

\subsubsection{Rumours of Magic}
Whether or not the book survived, one way or another, the item's magical activation word has been discovered\ldots or so the townsfolk think.  Everyone's talking about what they would do if they found the ``magical wishing amulet''.  Most people don't understand its powers, and think they can just wish to be king, or to be young.

Play another encounter immediately.

\subsubsection{The Mob}

\begin{boxtext}
	A trumpet at the city gate sounds off, and the Night Guard can be seen standing upon the great town wall, with three bloody criminals kneeling at their sides, and three severed heads in their hands.  The town crier shouts out.

	\begin{quotation}
		Hear ye, all!

		Our brave, and skillfull Night Guard have gone out to the depths of the forest, and pulled out some of the local bandits who have so terrorized the poor men and women in these lands, with theft and murder.

		They have lost one of their number, and we mourn the loss of \ldots how the hell do I say this?

		We mourn the loss of `Stanisele', who died fighting for King Wyatt of Fenestra.

		But we also celebrate, as the famous lizardite amulet, property of \gls{college}, was rested from the hands of the bandits.
	\end{quotation}

	One of the night guard holds the amulet aloft in great, gloved hands, but then fumbles, and slips.  The amulet falls smoothly to the ground.  The crowd hear the tiniest `clink', and then a young girl runs forward, shouting that she wants to wish for shoes.  The crowd begin to move, \emph{fast}.
\end{boxtext}

Getting through the crowd requires a Strength + Empathy roll, TN 10.  Town guards nearby also want to use the item, so they pull out their swords and prepare to cut down anyone stealing ``the king's properly''.  If the players don't intervene, the scene turns into a bloodbath within a couple of rounds.

Once finally obtained, an Intelligence + Academics roll at TN 10 shows that this is not the real amulet.

\subsubsection{They Took Our Jobs!}

\begin{speechtext}
	Don't try any funny business.  Just hand over the gold. Or silver.  Or at least definitely those boots -- god I'd kill for proper boots.  I mean, I actually will.  I'll kill you.  Hand them over.
\end{speechtext}

Pick a character who's most likely to go somewhere alone.  If that's not feasable, the party are ambushed when sleeping in a tavern.  However it goes down, they're being robbed by some wannabe-thieves.

\character{Clarisa and Robert}
\humanmaid

\character{Steven}
\humanthief

A quick Wits + Empathy check, TN 8, reveals they haven't a clue what they're doing.  Once the non-fight has ended, the characters might ask what these three think they were doing.  They reply that they once worked for a Villagemaster, but Clarisa was accused of stealing tax money.  Robert was set to guard the money after the next round of tax collection, but in the morning, it was all gone.  The next week, all the staff were fired, as their replacements had arrived.

They contest that they never stole a penny, and have no idea how it vanished.

\paragraph{The truth} of the matter is that the taxes in the local village were being paid with false coin -- villagers would use alchemically summoned gold to pay their taxes, and the coins would vanish the next day.

Move this encounter to the villages.

\subsubsection{The Old Lady}

\begin{boxtext}
	A grubby little girl dances down the road with bear feet, occasionally singing, then stopping.

		``Do you like my jewels?'', she asks.

	She has one massive green rock of immense value, hanging from a golden chain, and four bracelets on each arm, each studded with crystals.
\end{boxtext}

Emily wants to keep the source of her jewels a secret, and the characters have zero chance of bribing her.  After a day, the jewels vanish into thin air.

While Emily will not visit the old lady again, the characters have some chance of finding out what has happened, or at least part of it.  The bandits had the magical item, but were later apprehended by the Night Guard.  The bandit who had the item on him managed to escape into a nearby river, despite his wounds, but died soon after from bloodloss.  \Gls{necromancer}'s pet crow then summoned the corpse back to life, using his own magical item.  The corpse, amulet and all, then wandered through the forest until it found a village to attack, and proceeded to attempt to devour a family.  The family fought back against the dead, and soon won.

The family soon found that the magical item did not work with the expected command word, so they gave it to Martha in return for free use of its magic for three generations.  Martha agreed, pulled some strings, and a visit from a travelling gnome occurred soon after.  She now knows a dozen words in the Gnomish language,\footnote{\textit{Sledge, boots, gold-necklace, dry sticks, satchel, fancy bracelet, pestle, morta, horseshoe, bandage, water, frying pan, coat, hat} and \textit{bowl.}} for use with the item.

\character{Martha the Healer}

\person{-1}{0}{-3}{{1}{0}{1}}{0}{0}{Academics 1, Empathy 2, Medicine 3}{Lizardite amulet, bandages}{}

\subsubsection{Martha Returns}

If the characters left Martha with the magical item, to continue her good work in the villages, then there's one more part.  Combine this with the encounter below, and if the characters get into trouble, Martha comes to their aid.  If no, leave this encounter till the next time the characters are in trouble in the villages.

\subsection[The Trouble with Ale]{The Trouble with Ale -- \encnum}

The Ale Guild of the Bearded Mountains has taken dwarvish ale and takes it to the local town, then waters it down, and makes an absolute killing in profits.  The local Ale Guild aren't happy, and shenanigans ensue.

Darren, local Guild Master of town's Ale Guild, dresses his men as Knights\footnote{The term ``Knight'', is used by townsfolk for anyone in armour.  Guilds who travel need a lot of protection, as the roads are dangerous.} from the faraway Ale Guild of the Bearded Mountains.  In retaliation, Jafeth, dignitary to the Bearded Mountains' Ale Guild, destroys much of the local ale stores.

\subsubsection{The Drunken Knight}

\begin{boxtext}
	From the street ahead a drunken man in full plate armour falls against a wall, before getting back up and shouting at passers by that they're pathetic for drinking elvish nonsense, and need a proper dwarvish drink.
\end{boxtext}

This encounter can easily slip into the background -- the knight has no interest in assaulting the players, especially if they look well-armed.

\ldots except, he's not a knight.  He's a member of the local Ale Guild, and a patron of the temple of Alass\"e .   He's acting drunk and showing a symbol of the bearded mountains in order to give the rival sellers a bad reputation.

Players may notice he's pretending to be drunk with a Wits + Medicine roll, or notice that his coat or arms isn't painted onto his breastplate quite right with a Wits + Academics Roll.  Both have TN 12.

\character{Adrian, Town Ale Guild Member}

\person{2}{0}{1}{{0}{-1}{+1}}{0}{1}{Athletics 1, Deceit 1}{\longsword \completeplate}{\addtocounter{xpbonus}{-3}}

\subsubsection{Ale Explosion}

Play this encounter at the same time as the one below.

\begin{boxtext}
	Suddenly the house to your right explodes, and water rushes down the street, knocking aside stalls, women, two stray dogs, and sweeping the lot down the road.
\end{boxtext}

The party can avoid being swept down the street by the storm with a Wits + Athletics roll, TN 8.

\paragraph{Background:} The local Ale Guild found that the more ale is brewed, the cheaper it becomes.  They bought a few cheap houses around the city, and build massive barrels to house the ale in.  However, Jafeth, trader of the Bearded Mountains, found where they're stored, and paid a few street-rat children to mess the place up.  He never expected them to explode, however.

An Intelligence + Vigilance roll, TN 10, will allow the characters to find the children who started the problem, and they will eagerly point to Jafeth, who currently drinks in \gls{pig}.


\subsubsection{You Can't Drink Here}

\begin{boxtext}
	A crowd is vomiting out of a pub, pushing six men out with them\ldots or three men and three dwarves, all heavily armed.  The crowd shout for them to go back to the mountains and that they're not welcome in the area, but a dwarf, covered in metal from head to toe, and wearing the emblam of the Ale Guild from the Bearded Mountains, starts shouting back at them, listing laws concerning public houses and the rights of foreign Guild Captain.

	The crowd just jeer, making the dwarf steadily more angry.
\end{boxtext}

A party of three men and three dwarves from the Bearded Mountains are tired from a long day's walk, and need a rest and drink, but the townsfolk think of the Ale Guild from the Bearded Mountains as nothing but troublemakers.

Laxen, dwarvish captain of the group, has had enough of the bickering and feels tough in his full plate armour.  He has no idea that Jafeth has been pulling stunts, such as destroying the stores of the local Ale Guild.

If the characters do nothing, the crowd at one point pelt Laxen with some old soup, and some local ale.  He waves his axe, and a fight breaks out instantly.  The group then flee the city, and all ale trader with the Bearded Mountains stops.

\character{Guild Captain Laxen}
\dwarvensoldier

\character{Mugin \& Thunin, Dwarven Fellows of the Guild}

\dwarventrader

\character{Joshua, Robert and Rob, Fellows of the Guild}
\humansoldier

Jafeth still drinks at \gls{pig}.  

\paragraph{Conclusion:} If the characters can track down Jafeth of the Bearded Mountains Ale Guild, and have him talk with Darren, Guild Master of the local Ale Guild, they might be able to make peace between the two groups.  In this case, crisis is averted, and the final part can be discarded.

\subsubsection{We're Dry}
Play this encounter together with the one below.

\begin{boxtext}
	Later that day, you can find no rest in a tavern.  The first has run out of ale, and the second.  Asking around, people are saying they've all dried up, and now serve nothing but foul water.  The town are becoming agitated.
\end{boxtext}

For the next two encounters, all social rolls have a -2 penalty, as everyone around is feeling irritable.

Meanwhile, townsfolk are drinking more and more unpurified water, all of which has been tainted by the sickness of the nura who live in the sewers.  Raise the local nura rating by 1.

\subsection[Sewer Bandits]{Sewer Bandits -- \encnum}



\subsubsection{Bad Water}

\begin{boxtext}
	You stop at a nearby fountain, as everyone does in the town, but the water taste's suddenly foul.

	The rest of the night, others make the same complaints about the rotten taste.
\end{boxtext}

\subsubsection{Unexpected Zombies}

\begin{boxtext}
	Screams errupt next door.  Feet move quickly, and before you've properly heard what's happening, the streets are dead.
\end{boxtext}

20 of the undead are out.  If the characters confront the dead head-on, they will have a bad time, but town 4 guards are close to hand.  A Charisma + Empathy roll at TN 5 will smooth the situation over, with the guads arriving in 4 rounds, with -1 round per Margin on the TN.

The zombies will be put to the sword in quick order, but the question remains; what brought them here?

\paragraph{Background:} The dead were being held in the sewers, and broke out when someone didn't lock them in properly.  There's little way for the characters to find this out, though they will definitely note that the zombies were recently deceased people from the town.


\subsubsection{Underground Assassins}

\begin{boxtext}
	You heard guards shouting ``After them!'', in the distance'', and quickly scurrying feet, as a woman shouts for someone to help her husband.
\end{boxtext}

If the characters run to help Thomas, it's Wits + Medicine, at TN 9.

If they run after the thieves, it's Speed + Athletics.

\begin{tcolorbox}[tabularx={cX},arc=1mm]

	12 & \textit{``Giving chase, you catch up to four men running from the scene of the crime.''} \\
	11 & \textit{``You run round an alley, and find a drain cover clanking. The assassing have jumped underground.''} \\
	9 & \textit{``You run in hot persuit, but the attackers have disappeared down a street, into thin air.''} \\
	7 & \textit{``The attackers sprint away, leaving you running in the dark.''} \\

\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph{Background:} Villagemaster Jeremiah recently asked a number of guards about recent nura sightings, and why there was suspicious activity in town, such as the strange Whitelander accent he heard in \gls{whitehorse}.  He got too close, and \gls{banditking} felt he had to die, so four men were requested to pretend to be drunk while walking down the street, and then suddenly stab him in the neck.

\paragraph{Next:} If the party follow the assassins underground, go to page \pageref{sewers}.  Otherwise, this incident will remain a mystery.

If Villagemaster Thomas survives, he has little idea of what's happening, although an Intelligence + Vigilance roll (TN 10) could reveal what he's been asking abour recently.



\subsubsection{The Nura Rise}

\begin{speechtext}
	Listen, you need to help my friends.  They were normal until a moment ago.  These things came up.  I think they're nura.  And they're all like them now\ldots but you need to help them.
\end{speechtext}

\gls{sewerking} has lost control, the nura have broken out while tunneling underground, and the town is in turmoil.

Every area the characters move through has them encounter $2D6$ deep hobgoblins.

\begin{boxtext}
	Two men are pummeling each other.  One limps and the other's nose is burst open and streaming down his shirt, but they continue circling like boxers.  Two guards cry out and run forward to stop the public disturbance, and the two men immediately run together into \gls{pig}.

\begin{boxtext}
	Alassean song and cooked pig wafts hits you in the face as soon as the door opens.  With only three tables in the room, people have carved out little seating circles on the ground.  A fat cat with a brown collar sits in the rafters eyes you suspiciously as you struggle through the disorganized crowd to get to the bar.

\end{boxtext}

The cat's name is Bob, and his collar is made from dried, woven daffodil.  The collar is activated by shouting the elvish word for `dragon', at which point Bob will turn into a nura cat until someone says the elvish word for `cat'.

\begin{boxtext}
	\Gls{pigowner} slams the door at the back of the room hard, blocking the view of the man who was out there.  Nancy tells you to leave, as if she were shooing 
\end{boxtext}

The man at the back door is Peter -- one of the local Whiteland nobles. He's had to take to theft and occasionally spies on people to survive, like so many other dispossessed nobles.  Nobody can know that he lives below -- he just came by to grab a meal before heading back out to become a labourer for \gls{cleverbaron} so the underground bandits can keep an eye on what he's doing.

\character{\Glsentrytext{pigowner}}

\Gls{pigowner} has owned the pig since her father forged the inheritence documents, then died of alcohol poisoning shortly afterwards.

\subsubsection{Jane's Room}


\begin{boxtext}
	Perfumes and sex fill your noses.  The wide room practically begs for shoes to be removed as it's filled with pillows, throws, and blankets.  The only raised platform is a table strewn with fortune-telling cards, where Jane sits with a headband made of gold.
\end{boxtext}

Jane, priestess of Alass\"{e}, works here as a prostitute and organizes much of the cash inflow of other prostitutes.  She has a lot of respect and time for what the dispossessed nobles of Whiteland want to achieve, though she doesn't know the details, and has no idea that the undead are wandering around below.

Under Jane's fortune-telling card table the floorboards are loose, and lead to a new room, muffled by a thick curtain.  The number of people entering here has lead to wild rumours about the number of men Jane satisfies each day, and the number of hours they spend in there.  However, the reality is that almost everyone who enters the room simply wants to go to the secret sidechamber.


\subsubsection{Thieves' Den}


\begin{boxtext}
	Three men sit crosslegged on the floor, quietly playing cards.  The second they see you, an additional layer of silence enters the room.

A number of local thieves know of this secret and secluded room.  It was once a side-chamber in a temple to Qualm\"{e} and Ohta, but now houses only ruffians who want to speak about good places to steal, or shady opportunities for extortion.

\character{Three Cutthroats}

\subsubsection{Pantry}

\Gls{pigowner} used to store additional casks of ale, the good wine, and the best salted pork in here.  However, last month she heard a maid screaming and ran down to check on what had happened.  Through the door to the pantry she saw some undead creature chewing the still-living maid's face off, one piece at a time and immediately slammed the door shut.  Her shaking hand locked the door, then she gathered metals from the kitchen to jam into the lock so that it could never be opened again.

The theives who live in the sewers have apologized to \gls{pigowner} for letting the creature escape, but none have volunteered to open the door.  On its way out they could see it was a different sort of undead -- not a regular zombie, but something with a mind, and the ability to plan.

The creature looks like a regular, skinny woman, with long brown hair, dead around six months.  However, the simple shell hosts a powerful necromancer.

\character{Monster in the Celler}

The creature has already risen the maid from the dead, and has an escape plan.  It will create a magical mist as it hears anyone attempting to enter the door.  Once the door opens, the mist pours out, obscuring all vision, and the zombie-maid will come shambling out.  Anyone attempting to kill the creature inside should instinctively attack the maid, and in the confusion, the monster from the celler will attempt to stealth its way outside.  In Jane's room, it will cover itself in blankets, posing as an embarrassed man who must leave unseen.  Once on the street, it can find an alley to hide in, and begin its murderous rampage before diving into the river at the first sign of a mob.

\subsubsection{Runoff}

The first character rolls Wits + Vigilance, TN 8.


\begin{boxtext}
	A little river can be heard ahead.  The torchlight shines on a thin but tought rope, stretching across a passage to the right.  The little river flows down steeply, fed by a gushing crack in the wall.  It's not clear if the rope was to server as a poor guard-rail or as a tripwire to send people tumbling down.
\end{boxtext}

Various little pipes, nooks, and gutters in the city lead underground.  This little drain pops out here, and heads steadily downhill, eventually landin in the Sewers below (see page \pageref{slidein}).

The first member of the party to go down the tunnel rolls to spot the tripwire, and failure means they immediately go tumbling downwards to the sewers.

\subsubsection{Ventilation Shaft}
This little tunnel reaches upwards to allow a modicum of fresh air to circulate down in the nasty little dungeon.  Characters with a Strength of 0 or greater are too large to fit through the narrow hole.  It emerges on a street, just below a rich man's house.

\subsubsection{The Temple of War}
Long ago, the twin temples to Ohta and Qualm\"{e} stood closeby, although the priests always had a respectful distrust of eath other.  They each barred the door from their own side, and allowed it to open only during prearranged meetings.

\Gls{pigowner} has since covered the door with a shrine to Alass\"{e}, along with a large wooden backing which covers the door.  She doesn't want the various thieves who come down here to get the idea that they can raid a sacred temple, as it'll only cause more trouble.

The temple's lowest room is filled with expensive tapestries, swords, axes, and other items, each catalogued according to an extensive system they require to stay legal.  \Gls{king} has very precise rules about the ownership of weapons.

\subsubsection{The Ossuary}
The locked door requires an Intelligence + Larceny check, TN 11, to open.

\begin{boxtext}
	The door swings inwards to show a full room decorated in bone.  Skulls arranged in circles, with shoulder-blades making a decorative backing, little stick-figures carved from femurs, tibulae and fibulae, and pillars, dripping with candlewax, crafted from metal bolts holding up skulls and rib-bones.  Among all of them, gold coins sit in eyesockets, and jewels have been wedged into the ribs.  A sparkling treasure rests all around the room.

	Letters in Quenya state ``We bones await yours''.
\end{boxtext}

The temple of Qualm\"{e} held its fasting chambers here, where men would compete to stay underground and hungry the longest, with the winner receiving accolades, honour, and feasts.  Anyone who died won instantly, and their family received double the normal price money, along with their departed's skull, newly painted with sacred quotations.

The total value of the jewels inside here is 350gp.  \Gls{pigowner}, and the bandits know better than to go graverobbing, especially when they are aware the old temple had guardians.

Three men competed and won the right to protect the temple.  They starved themselves into a state of lichdom after being burried alive in one of the walls.  While the hidden room, being covered in bricks is almost impossible to detect (TN 14), they can break those bricks down at any point.

This path downwards leads to the thieves' den underground (see page \pageref{pigexit}).

\subsubsection{Drinking Hall}


\begin{boxtext}
	A large man with a well-greased moustache halts you at the door.

	\begin{quotation}
		My good gentlemen and excellent ladies, I've been looking all over town for a noble from Whiteland.  Do you know where I might find him?
	\end{quotation}


\end{boxtext}

	Elric wants to know if the characters are loyal to the king -- and all loyal subjects know that there \emph{are} no nobles in Whiteland, because the king has chased them all out.

	\begin{speechtext}
		You don't know?  Well I have an idea -- if he's around here, he'll be in the jail, which is where riff raff go who go where they're not wanted!  Servants use the sidedoor, so go out to the street you go!
	\end{speechtext}

	If the characters answer correctly, they're let in, but the establishment will be leary of them -- there's no real incentive to make money here, the patrons are a small group of elites, and a few polite traders.

	The hall contains various villagemasters playing games, and half a dozen local guards.

	\subsubsection{Kitchen}
	The staff sleep here during long shifts.  The lack of proper ventilation makes the air difficult to breathe.

	\subsubsection{The Courtyard}

\begin{boxtext}
	\Gls{townmaster} has his legs tied together and is hopping away from a coterie of chuckling men.  A chicken runs out in front of him with a little paper hat.  \Gls{townmaster} lunges forwards and grabs the chicken in his teeth.  As the chicken reaches the peak of its small voice, \gls{townmaster} shakes the chicken back and forth like a rabid dog until the chicken stops clucking.

	The crowd cheer, and another man steps forward to have his feet bound.
\end{boxtext}

The courtyard usually contains a couple of carriages, and nobles playing ridiculous games.

\subsubsection{Upstairs}

Upstairs contains two rooms, a load of equipment for the tavern, sleeping matts for favoured servants, and bookshelves.

The bookshelves contain rather a lot of history books, most focussing upon anti-elven propaganda, such as the time they destroyed the now-lost city.

\subsection{The Guard Station}\label{guardstation}
The Grounds are patrolled by a minimum of five guards at any point.  \Gls{captain} has an obsession with guards constantly rotating around the premise.  As a result, they've hidden a stash of whiskey in the bushes at the back, and sometimes have `rounds', while they do the rounds.

The wooden buildings tacked into the outer wall have thin rooves which constantly bend and creak -- walking silently across them is impossible for anything with a total weight of 4 or more.

\subsubsection{The Dungeon}


\begin{boxtext}
	With a hood shoves over your head, you're taken down a set of stairs, then spun around, then down another, spun around again, then taken down another set of stairs, spun around again, then pushed hard down a long hallway.  The stench of shit fills the room.  You hear a horrible, inhuman, roar, feel something slippery under your feet, then pull right, down the hall, right again and two steps later the bag's pulled from your head, and you see a small pair of eyes in the darkness in front of you as the door slams shut behind you.  The lock clinks shut in the darkness, and the little voice asks ``Hello?''.
\end{boxtext}

Some time ago, the guards captured an ogre, and \gls{townmaster} ordered them to keep it alive so he could better understand the nura, and perhaps to bring it out as a pet one day.  Since then he's forgotten about it, but the guards have to keep feeding it.  Twice a day, they take a cart down the stairs, deal out a small portion to each of the inmates, then place the rest by the great door as a massive, grabbing hand reaches out the shutter and piles the food into its mouth.

They didn't know what to do about a toilet, and they've never wanted to move the ogre, so the ogres shits in a bucket, and once a day it throws the contents out of the hatch and onto a guard.  This is the only fun the ogre has, and the the biggest irritation the guards have to put up with.

\subsection{\hspace{4.5cm}The Lost Library}\label{sewers}\setcounter{list}{0}

\vspace{-1.2cm}

\includesvg{images/Dyson_Logos/sewer.svg}\label{sewer_map}

The old temple of Qualm\"{e} stretched deep underground, and soon after a library was commissioned by local alchemists, which was share a space.  The place held students, priests, alchemists, and a grand library.  However, once the nearby city was destroyed, there was no longer enough money, pilgrims, or students hoping to oneday see the great university of the city to sustain the underground library, or the temple.

A century later, an earthquake destroyed most of the arae, and was left silent.

When the Whiteland nobles, bereft of a home and desperate, found they had this secret space available in \gls{pig}, they dug their way down as quickly as they could.  The nearby sewage stream, heading swiftly underground, made pulling rocks and mud out simple.

The doors are all locked by a single key, and barred from the bandits' side.  Lockpicking them requires an Intelligence + Larceny roll, TN 10 if the bar's down, and TN 14 otherwise.

%!

\mapentry{Stairway to the Bakers}
This stairway has been dug upwards to a drain just outside of a bakery.  The bandits enter and exit through here.

The staircase has a large barrel sitting at the top, filled with pitch, offal, and mud.  Anyone tipping it over fills the path downward with a slippery material, and moving upwards becomes exceedingly difficult.  Anyone running up rolls Dexterity + Athletics, TN 14.  Every failure margin slows characters by 1 square, and anyone getting 7 or less falls back down the path.  The barrel is heavy enough to cause $1D6-2$ Damage, and avoiding it requires a Wits + Athletics roll, TN 8; stopping the barrel entirely needs a Strength + Athletics roll TN 11.

% 7 areas

\mapentry{The Old Library }\label{oldlibrary}

\begin{boxtext}

	Markings on the walls show where hundreds of bookshelves once provided the entire city knowledge, but not a scrap of paper remains, and the only remaining shelves lie broken on the ground.  High above, the braziers hang inactive between three great stone pillars.  Each wall has four alcoves for specialist books, but now has nothing.

\end{boxtext}

Players might be expecting a dramatic fight as an enemy pops out from the alcoves.  There isn't one.  The only thing to find here is a single alcove which was dug through, leading to a brutally hacked-out tunnel.

Observant characters may notice that a single brazier looks different from the rest.  It's from the underground realm through the portal, and raises any dead in the area as zombies.

\mapentry{The Dogs}
The original function of this room's been long forgotten.  Currently various dogs are chained here as an early warning signal.  The dogs have been stolen from the streets, and a number of people would like to see them returned.

The dogs won't sound any alarm until they see the characters -- they're used to people moving about, and generally anticipate being fed when they hear footsteps.  They also don't panic when seeing the undead, as the undead have no interest in attacking them.

\mapentry{Dead Storage}


\begin{boxtext}
	Ahead is another set of door with those strange dead creatures behind them.  Arms reach out, filling the hallway.
\end{boxtext}

\Gls{patron} has gifted hobgoblin bands to make new tunnels, so the bandits can carve out their own little underground kingdom.  Once the hobgoblins die, they're raised from the dead by the brazier hanging in the old library (page \pageref{oldlibrary}).

Each room holds $1D6+3$ undead hobgoblins.  Each also holds one of the sentient undead who were smuggled into the area.  The sentient ones will not attack first -- they will show restraint, stay behind the other dead, and in general interest themselves with plotting how to get the gate open permanently once \gls{patron} wishes it.

\monster{Undead Hobgoblins}
\zombiehobgoblin

Anyone attempting to move through a hallway filled with these narrow tunnels must roll Speed + Athletics, TN 8 or be grabbed by one, at which point another gets a chance to grab the character.

\mapentry{Magical Item Storage}


\begin{boxtext}
	The rings of shelves show a strange assortment of items -- jars filled with human teeth, an old brazier, dried snowdrops, and a vial of blood.
\end{boxtext}

\Glsentrytext{sewerking} stashes most of his prizes in this room on a simple series of shelves.  Each is cast with Intelligence +1, Wits +1.

\begin{enumerate}

	\item{A bag of teeth that turn into anything, as per Conjuration level 2.}
	\item{A vial of lamb's blood which makes the user invisible to the dead and immune to fatigue (as per Necromancy level 1).}
	\item{A pressed Autumnal leaf, which releases 2 mana when destroyed.}
	\item{An ancient scroll, proclaiming elves the friends of humans, and seven reasons not to worry about nobles being assassinated.  Anyone reading the scroll can raise any creature in the vicinity from the dead, regardless of size, as per the third level of Necromancy.}
	\item{The Assassination Dagger, which inflicts an additional $1D3+1$ HP Damage with every attack.}
	\item{Discordant music -- when played it transports the singer to the Realm of Bright Rocks.}
	\item{Magic Mushrooms, enchanted with Saurecanta level 2 to decrease the user's Charisma by 3 and increase Speed by the same ammount.}
	\item{A slashed painting of a broken castle -- damaging it summons an archmage.}
	\item{Foul alcohol in a bottle, which makes the imbiber regenerate fatigue if they eat, and otherwise inflicts hunger paints, as per Saurecanta level 1.}
\end{enumerate}

\mapentry{Portal Room}


\begin{boxtext}
	The grand hall's end glistens with jewels of all colours of the rainbow, arranged around a great stone sphere, with a single concave side facing the room.

	The rest of the massive hallway contains nothing but a couple of ale casks and stools.  Five doors line the far side, and another two doors on the side of the room you came from.

\end{boxtext}

A moment later, the characters hear doors moving as the bandits wake up.  Each room contains two.

The portal's command words are nowhere to be found here, but can be researched with an Intelligence + Academics roll, TN 16 (or 10 with a good library).  If opened, a portal opens directly to the Realm of Darkness and Fire (page \pageref{darknessandfire}).

\mapentry{\Glsentrytext{sewerking}'s Room}

\begin{boxtext}
	The door opens to a noble's room, bearing a striking contrast to the dungeon around.  The bed's well made, the sheets are silk, and various books sit on shelves.  On the table sits various maps.
\end{boxtext}

\begin{itemize}

	\item{The city map shows every entry point the bandits can enter the city above, including the theoretical passage the bandits think could be found again under \glsentrytext{townmaster}'s Citadel.}
	\item{A map of the area, outlining \glsentrytext{lostcity}, the portal by \glsentrytext{redfall}, and \gls{necromancer}'s lair.}
	\item{A complete map of the current location -- the Abandoned Library.}
\end{itemize}

Besides the map, the table has an emergency magical item -- an egg, which grants +5 Speed and Strength, but -5 Charisma and Intelligence.  It activates once broken, whether thrown at someone, or broken on purpose.

\mapentry{Food Storage}


\begin{boxtext}
	Barrel after barrel fill the room, along with the smell of wine, apples, and vinegar.  A little basket of choice snacks sits on top.
\end{boxtext}

The room is normal, except for the basket of choice snacks, which is poisoned with an intense laxative.  \Gls{sewerking} suspects one of his men steals food when returning from business in town, so he's left a basket of poisoned food.  Someone can tell it's poisoned with a Wits + Medicine roll, TN 8.  Failure means the character will have a bad night, and gain 3 Fatigue Points.

 
\mapentry{The Drowned Hallway}

The tunnels are a little moist.  It's not very noticeable, but bit by bit, the lowest portion of the tunnels have been flooded.  The bandits had already locked up two jails of five undead, but decided to abandon them since the flood.


\begin{boxtext}
	Going down the stairs you feel your feet hitting cold water.  It's not clear how far the water goes down, but it's cold.
\end{boxtext}

The water goes up to the ceiling by the last step, and for four squares after.  Each zombie-stuffed room the characters pass the dead will lash out, with TN 12 to escape the grabbing hands, assuming the characters aren't Keeping Edgy, and are blind.

\mapentry{Ogre Dust}

\begin{boxtext}
	A little thread pushes against your face, like a steel spiderweb.  A second later, something flutters around your head.  The falling debris feels annoying beyond words, and it's difficult to say why -- you simply feel incredibly irritated, and hungry.  \emph{Extremely} hungry.
\end{boxtext}

A thin wire was stretched across the floor, leading up to a small stretch of leather, holding snowdrops.  Anyone failing a Wits + Vigilance roll, TN 12 in the twilight, feels the petals fall down.  A moment later, the character's aflicted as per Saurecanta, level 2, and gains +4 Strength at the cost of -5 Charisma.

\mapentry{Entrance to the Citadel}

\begin{boxtext}
	The picks and torches on the ground show that someone's been working their way into the ground.  At the moment, the tunnel ends in a dead end.
\end{boxtext}
 
The single square of rock ahead is made of fallen debris, so the PCs can move it far easier than most rock walls.  They can make a Strength + Crafts roll, TN 9.  They'll need to accumulate a total margin of 10, whether in one roll, or many, in order to clear the way.

\label{pigexit}

\mapentry{Sewer Entrance}\label{slidein}

This path follows an arteficial stream, which goes downhill from \gls{pig}, above.  The stream continues downwards to an underground area and then goes underground.  Anyone venturing down here simply dies in the unending blackness.


\mapentry{Entrance to \glsentrytext{pig}}

Up these stairs, characters can reach the bowels of \gls{pig}.  If they're bursing out to see the place for the first time, people will know they're not regulars and attack.  Once up, everyone in \gls{pig} will deny any knowledge of the deeper tunnels, and the fact that bandits lived down there.
