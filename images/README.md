If you want to add art:

- SVG is preferred, because git can track the changes properly.
	- Yes, you can change existing work, and every 'brush' stroke will have the appropriate name attached, as long as you're using .svg format.
- You're free to apply a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike licence.  The GPL will preserve it.
	- Only GPL or Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike licences are compatible with this work.
- Make sure you're noted in the artists' markdown file.
- It's fine to replace art in the book, but all artists should remain in the artists' example file, 'artists.md'.
- You're awesome!
